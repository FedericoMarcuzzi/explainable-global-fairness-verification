# Explainable Global Fairness Verification

This repository contains the implementation of the synthesiser of sufficient conditions for fairness for decision-tree ensembles proposed by **Calzavara *et. al.*** in their research paper titled [<em>Explainable Global Fairness Verification of Tree-Based Classifiers</em>](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HOu7LgqCTqd). At the moment, this repository contains the code of the synthesiser. The scripts to scripts to reproduce the experiments described in the paper will be added soon.

## Installation
Download the repository. Remember to compile using the flags <em>-Iinclude</em> and <em>-lpthread</em> to use the synthesiser.

### Requirments
The following requirements are necessary to use the analyzer. For reproducibility reasons, specific versions of the libraries are required.
- Python3
- C++14 compiler
- sklearn (version 0.23.2 used for the experiments)
- pandas (version 1.1.3 used for the experiments)
- numpy (version 1.19.1 used for the experiments)
- boost C++ libraries
  
### Data-Independent Stability Analysis
The resilience-verification repository at [https://github.com/FedericoMarcuzzi/resilience-verification](https://github.com/FedericoMarcuzzi/resilience-verification) contains the instructions to execute the data-independent stability analysis on the tree-based classifier.
At the moment, this repo contains the essential code to perform the data-independent stability analysis. 

## Usage

### Apply pre-processing to datasets

The synthesizer requires the dataset to be pre-proc by applying 0-1 normalization and one-hot-encoding to the categorical features.
If you want to use datasets not provided by this repo, have a look at the pre-processing functions contained in <em>./data_gen/misc.py</em> and to the datasets folder in order to understand which files must be generated (names are self explanatory).

For what concerns the datasets used in the experimental evaluation in the paper, execute the command inside the <em>data_gen</em> folder:
```bash
python3 preproc_<dataset_name>.py
```

### Generate decision tree ensembles with the supported format
After the dataset pre-processing, execute the following command inside the <em>data_gen</em> folder:
```bash
python3 generate_data.py <dataset_abbreviation> 1 <random_seed>
```
By using this command, the pre-proc dataset is splitted in training-set and test-set.

Supported dataset abbreviations are "ad" (adult), "gm" (german) and "ht" (health). Add our abbreviations in <em>generate_data.py</em> if you want to support other datasets.

Then, execute the following command from the data_gen folder to generate a decision tree-ensemble in the supported format:

```bash
python3 generate_data.py <dataset_abbreviation> 0 <random_seed> <n_trees> <max_depth>
```

### Use the synthesizer

Compile the synthesiser using the following string:
```bash
g++ -o synthesizer ./src/exec_analyser_synthesiser.cpp -Iinclude -lpthread
```

The program requires these arguments:
```bash
./synthesizer <ensemble_filename.json> <columns_filename.json> <categorical_columns_names.json> <numerical_columns_indexes.json> <categorical_columns_indexes.json> <protected_attribute> <n_iter_analyze> <n_threads> <n_threads_filtering> <filename_dump_hyperrects.json> <test_set_filename.json> <n_iter_synthesiser> <output_conditions_filename_base.json> <normalizations_columns_conditions.json>
```
The specific parameters are:
- <em>ensemble_filename.json</em>: the JSON file containing the structure of the tree-based classifier.
- <em>columns_filename.json</em>: the JSON file containing all the names of the features.
- <em>categorical_columns_names.json</em>: the JSON file containing the names of the categorical features.
- <em>numerical_columns_indexes.json</em>: the JSON file containing the indexes of the numerical features.
- <em>categorical_columns_indexes.json</em>: the JSON file containing the indexes of the categorical features.
- <em>protected_attribute</em>: name of the sensitive attribute.
- <em>n_iter_analyze > 0</em>: number of iterations performed by the data-independent stability analyzer.
- <em>n_threads > 1</em>: number of used threads by the the data-independent stability analyzer.
- <em>filename_dump_hyperrects.json</em>: name of the file in which the hyper-rectangles generated by the DISA will be dumped.
- <em>n_iter_synthesiser > 0</em>: number of iterations performed by the synthesizer.
- <em>output_conditions_filename_base</em>: prefix of the name of the files that will contain the generated conditions separated by their complexity.
- <em>normalizations_columns_conditions.json</em>: file containing minimu, maximum, mean and std for any feature.

#### Example
```bash
./synthesizer ./adult/models/rf_ad_5_6_7.json ./adult/ad_column_names.json ./adult/ad_categorical_column_names.json ./adult/ad_numerical_binary_column_index.json ./adult/ad_categorical_column_index.json sex_male 40 1 ./res/adult/hypers/hypers_ad_5_6_7_100iterA 4 ./res/adult/fair_conditions/fair_conditions_ad_5_6_7_100iterA_1threadF ./adult/ad_normalization_info.json
```
